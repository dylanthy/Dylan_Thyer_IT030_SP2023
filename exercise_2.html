		<h1>Centripetal Acceleration</h1>

		<div style="background-color: turquoise;"><p>Centripetal Acceleration is the inward acceleration when an object is spinning in a circle. The Centripetal force is the force causing this acceleration, and can be calculated by using formulas.</p></div>

		<p><b>Formulas:</b> F = 4π2mR/T2, F = 4π2mRf2<br/>
		<i><span style="color:darkmagenta;"> where T is the period of rotation</span></i><span style="color:red"><i> and f is thefrequency of rotation</i></span><br/></p>

		<p>Each of these formulas is comprised of a mass, speed component, and radius component. If you proportionally change these, for example the mass and radius, but keep the same force, time will change to counteract the new mass and radius. These experiments were done to find the consistency of the formulas in our space. Our results found that the frequency found vs the frequency calculated using the formula had an unusually high percent error average of 52.1%. This could only be explained by a major systematic error or miscalculation. As our percent errors follow similar trends within our findings.</p>
