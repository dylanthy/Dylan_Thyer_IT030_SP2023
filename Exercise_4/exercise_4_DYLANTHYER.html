					<p>My name is Dylan Thyer, I wrote some sample text for this page taken from a previously written essay.</p>
					<p>For many artists and musicians, music is a platform to express themselves, share stories and experiences with their audience. Majority of the time, artists use this platform to share regular experiences, from love stories to mental health issues. More recently however, there has been an increasing amount of music regarding drugs and substance use. To many, this is a serious issue; parents wouldn’t want their children listening to rap songs that condone the use of drugs, as it can glorify the use of drugs to their audience, and for good reason. Why would you want youth to be exposed to music regarding drugs that doesn’t properly teach them about substance use. Although there are some songs that do explicitly condemn the use of drugs, songs that reference drugs will, majority of the time, will express their approval of drug use, rather than disapproval.</p>
					<p>It’s easy to blame newer genres, like rap music for this surge in drug-related music. Coming to the conclusion that rap music condones drug use is an extremely narrow perspective and completely ignores the broader issue at hand. Substance use is a recurring idea that has been used across a variety of different genres. Alcohol is sung about in many songs, across many genres, and nobody seems to mind, unless it is rap music. Substance use in music is an extremely difficult topic to write about, and portray a clear message regarding it to the listener. Specifically rap music, it can be difficult to understand what exactly the artist is saying, listeners could only 
					pick up key parts and details of songs, some that refer to drugs. Music that includes lyrics regarding drugs and substance use tend to glorify the use of them, even if they don’t condone the use of them, they can still inadvertently promote drugs to the audience. It is important to learn about drugs, and how they affect people, but music that explicitly condones or promotes usage of substances shouldn’t be listened to by the majority of audiences who typically listen to this music.</p>
					<p>While drugs have been heard in music for quite some time, more recently, drugs and substance use has become mainstream, being referenced time and time again in countless songs across all genres. The topic has become mainstream within our culture, allowing itself to be exposed to a larger audience. Studies conducted in 2005 concluded that “Of the 279 songs, 93 (33.3%) portrayed substance use” (Primack). The study analyzed Billboard’s list of 2005’s most popular songs. Not only did the study conclude that ⅓ of the year’s most popular songs referenced substance use, it was seen across multiple genres, specifically “with 1 or more references in 3 of 35 pop songs (9%), 9 of 66 rock songs (14%), 11 of 55 R&B/hip-hop songs (20%), 22 of 61 country songs (36%), and 48 of 62 rap songs (77%)” (Primack). There’s nothing wrong with talking about drugs, opening a discussion to audiences with less exposure can help them learn about the topic, but as the article states “Most songs with substance use (68%) portrayed more positive than negative consequences; these positive consequences were most commonly social, sexual, financial, or emotional” (Primack). This study concludes that  the songs that do reference drug or substance use, around ⅔ specifically portray drugs positively. The study was only conducted within a year, and only looked at one year’s songs, who were compiled a Billboards ranking. Some could argue these factors could heavily influence the conclusion of this study. Billboard’s music popularity rankings are regarded as the standard for music popularity within the industry, and they receive their data from MRC Data, a provider of sales statistics of music across many industries and services. It is possible that 2005 was a year where music suddenly started involving substance use within their music, although not impossible, it is unlikely this trend was specific to the year 2005, rather a slowly increasing trend within music to this day.</p>

					<p>Substance abuse has always had ties to rap music ever since its popularization in the 1970s, and for good reason. Rap music hasn’t always had such an enormous amount of substance references in its music. “Of the 38 most popular rap songs between 1979 and 1984, only four (11 percent) contained drug references. By the late 1980s, that increased to 19 percent and by 1993, to 69 percent.”(Preidt). Rap music has always had ties to substance abuse, arguably due to the culture surrounding rap seeming to have more relations to substance use than other genres of music. But that number has steadily increased over time, now to an extremely high percentage. Typically, when someone thinks of substance use in music, their first thought is rap music, and that’s a fair assumption, but people also tend to blame specifically rap music for its correlation to drugs. Drugs in music is an issue relating to all genres, and not specifically rap. Seen in the statistics within the previous paragraph, many genres can contain references to substance use. Although there aren’t as many references in  those genres compared to rap within the study, other genres still contain references to drugs. It’s ignorant to think this is an issue regarding only rap music, when the issue is far larger than just a single genre. Genres like rock have referenced alcohol and other substances time and time again, but it is generally accepted.</p>

					<p>The seemingly growing popularity of drugs within music can also severely affect the creators themselves. As other creators start to make more and more songs about substance use, there is the possibility that they would feel pressured to also make music regarding substance use, possibly to keep relevance, or stay popular. No matter the reason, this mentality isn’t the artist’s fault, rather it’s an accumulation of the industry’s problems regarding drugs. Many artists might start using drugs as they could feel pressured to keep up their speed of creating music. “Often in popular music, a singer/songwriter’s first foray into recording involves working with material that has been developed over a number of years. If success hits they find themselves commercially pressured to generate more material in vastly reduced time.” (Paul Saintilan, 6). Artists may feel the need to use drugs as a way to speed up their creative process, and for some artists can become an addiction. This is only the start of the vicious cycle of substance abuse seen within the music industry. Later, artists who have used drugs might feel the necessity to include drugs in their music, which can in turn into a deeper addiction to drugs for the user, possibly feeling thankful for the substance giving the artist something to write about. Later, once these songs are released, most songs will act as advertisements for drugs to their audiences. This cycle of drug related music is not only bad because it hurts many within it, it also allows the idea substance use in music to become acceptable, when in reality, we shouldn’t accept music that blatantly promotes drug use to our youth, and doesn’t actually teach them useful information regarding drugs.</p>
					<p>While the majority of music regarding drugs doesn’t properly educate their listeners about the substance, it is possible for music to teach their audience better than other methods. It’s pretty obvious, youth don’t like to engage with many of the typical resources we have that try to  teach youth about drugs. Firstly, methods like that don’t truly teach children about drugs, rather they just tell the audience drugs are bad, lacking a true explanation for the reasoning behind their message, and leaving the audience feeling like they were just bombarded with propaganda. Music however, can act as a better messenger to properly teach their audience about substances. If audiences are passionate about the music that they enjoy, they will probably care more about the message being told to them. Music is extremely influential on youth, “students who were exposed to more marijuana references in music were nearly twice as likely to smoke pot than those who weren’t exposed to as many marijuana-based lyrics” (McDonald). In theory, if music that promotes substance use is that effective, music that properly teaches about drugs will probably engage their audience more than traditional methods of drug education. In actuality, this isn’t likely to become the norm. Musicians write about their own experiences, and in the case of using drugs, the majority of the time they will only share their good experiences. There are many reasons as to why they wouldn’t share their bad experiences, but if the majority of songs talk positively about drugs, they will likely only want to share positive experiences over negative experiences trying to be like the rest of artists. Music has the potential to be a great medium to educate youth on substance use, but probably won’t happen due to musicians likely not wanting to.</p>
